- What challenges have you faced with online or self-paced learning?  
One of my biggest challenges with online/self-paced learning is not getting enough guidance. I'm a quick learner when someone can talk with me and discuss a topic - but reading documentation is where I begin to struggle. It is difficult for me to learn by reading; however, if I have a piece to read and then after I can receive guidance from someone who is like-minded I should be able to understand the material easily.
- Do you have any learning strategies or methods of learning that work well for you?  
My biggest learning strategy or methods of learning is by copying things that other people build and then expand on them. For example, someone could create a calculator app with a plus and minus option - then I would take that project and add a divide function or something of the like. I also learn quicker by discussing topics with others or listening to other people talk about a subject.
- What sort of digital learning resources would you be interested in creating?
I would like to create resources for STEM students if I were needed to create a digital learning resource.
