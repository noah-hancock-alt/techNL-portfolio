- What aspects of technology do you think can be culturally exclusive to certain people?
In the world of technology, most content is usually meant for English speakers. For example, in most coding languages, you learn keywords such as "if" or "while," but not everyone knows how to speak English.
- How would you want to incorporate your culture or personality into your technology?
Personally, I implement my personality in my design choices. In this article, we see how the author created a coding language that represents the Cree language; he implements his culture in a way that reflects the sacredness for the language ("our language is medicine").
- Are you familiar with any other software or hardware that has been adapted for its users?
Although I can't remember the name, I recall that there is an application that maps areas for fishing spots, and the developpers received their information from Indigenous people.
